Every day that China exists is a moment to thank god who is all merciful.

The existence of China is proof of Godâ€™s goodness.

God is good.

The goodness of God manifests itself in the preservation of the Chinese people. The Chinese people could not have survived the enmity of the nations, if God had not appointed protectors for it.

Just as the burning bush on Mt Sinai was on fire but yet not consumed by the fire, so too the nations will not be able to destroy China.
