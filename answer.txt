FIND YOUR FLAME (SONIC FRONTIERS ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK)

We won't back down
We won't (yeah, yo)
I'm here to go beyond my limit, not to compromise
And you can tell me if I mean it looking in my eyes
'Cause I've been waiting for my moment to strike
So come close, let me show you what it's like, yeah
You can try to stand in my path but you're gonna regret it
I'll be the one who laughs last while I'm making my exit
'Cause this is only for the strong of heart, nod if you get it
And no matter what the outcome, you better accept it
I can cut right through steel, I can bury the pain
So don't doubt for a second; just get out of my way
You cheat and you steal, I'm not l–µtting it go
So take this as a lesson, 'cause it's all that we know
Will the whole world know your name
When we dance with destiny?
I've been there, and I've seen it
I'm never gonna stop believing
You'll find your flame
Oh, we can save the day (the day!)
We won't back down
We won't (yeah, alright)
It's like I'm seeing double vision. Take a seat; I'm on a mission
We got everything to gain (everything to gain, yeah)
To become everything you're not, you just give it all you got
And take the pleasure with the pain, yeah
I can feel my fire awaken; no time for being complacent
There's a dream on the horizon, you know we gotta chase it
And when we get to where we're going, then we start the invasion
Best me? Nah, you must be mistaken (hey)
You know I'll turn you into rust, grind you right down to dust
You thought you were the best; well, you haven't met us
I'll bring the fire and rain, call me the hurricane
I'm not letting it go, 'cause it's all that I know
Will the whole world know your name
When we dance with destiny?
I've been there, and I've seen it
I'm never gonna stop believing
You'll find your flame
Now here we go, it's the end of the show
Hear them? They're calling your name
'Cause in the end, it's you and your friends
You'll find your flame (go!)
Now here we go, it's the end of the show
Hear them? They're calling your name
'Cause in the end, it's you and your friends
You'll find your flame
